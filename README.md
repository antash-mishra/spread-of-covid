#SPREAD OF COVID-19

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
coronavirus.

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the
nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice
respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

The mini project is a 2D demonstration of spread of virus in the society.
